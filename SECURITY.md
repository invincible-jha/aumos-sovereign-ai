## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this repository:

1. Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials (even test credentials)
2. Use parameterized queries — never string concatenation in SQL
3. Validate all inputs at system boundaries using Pydantic
4. Never log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII)
5. Check dependency licenses and security advisories before adding packages
6. Report any security issues you discover, even if you are not sure of the impact
